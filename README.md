# First-Webscraper-Project-2023
This is a webscraper project I made using node.js and packages axios, cheerio and express to collect title. I used Ania's youtube tutorial. Goal is to eventually use this template and build a better webscraper that mines useful data.

I am missing the node_modules folder from this file. As long as the express, cheerio and axios package are installed the index.js file should be able to run.
